# micropython-IL3897-driver
The driver file for an ePaper display driver IC (IL3897) with parameters selected for a 250x122 Lolin 2.13 inch EPD.

This is adapted from Mcauser's Waveshare ePaper driver series https://github.com/mcauser/micropython-waveshare-epaper/blob/master/epaper2in13.py and has been modified to work with Lolin 2.13 inch EPD.
